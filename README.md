# Starter

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and cover how to use `Express Routers` to break up the application to make it more maintainable. We will build the server and the routers from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.
